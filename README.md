# A News Aggregation System
This is a project about Bangladeshi Newspaper Scrapping.In This System we collects the Headlines, 
URLs and Content of Bangladeshi newspaper in both English and Bengali format. 
Basically we collect 6 types of news, these are Politics, National, Sports, International, Entertainment
and Science and Technology and aslo Breaking News or Latest News.
These information are then stored to the database. Then for every content we produce a small summary and 
then we show all the information to our website including the summary for each and every news.
We use Beautifulsoup4 for collecting news and for producing summary we use NLTK module for summarizing the news content 
and Django and Django Rest framework as Backend.
